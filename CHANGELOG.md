# Changelog

Most notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.6.9] - 2026-08-26

### Added
- `redfetch agent` prints instructions for your automaton, for those who prefer no ui at all.
- `redfetch server add <name> --eqpath <folder>` adds an emu server from the command line. `redfetch server --help` for more options.
- `redfetch config <path>` shows the current setting.

### Changed
- Opting out of a resource in settings.local.toml will now avoid updating even if watched.
- `AUTO_RUN_VVMQ` is now `"ask"` (default), `"always"`, or `"never"` instead of unset/true/false. Existing settings migrate.
- EMU is now labeled RoF2, both values work in CLI.

### Fixed
- Piping `redfetch` output on Windows no longer crashes on emoji in the help text.

## [1.6.0] - 2026-08-15

### Changed
- redfetch now refers to Live/Test/Emu as clients, e.g. `redfetch client live`, after the MacroQuest client type you're using. Previous commands still work.
- The "Very Vanilla MQ" button in the shortcuts tab (or `redfetch run mq`) will also run your configured post-update programs. 

### Added
- Multiple Emu-RoF2 server support. Emu players keep multiple copies of EverQuest, and redfetch will now support map updates and more for each copy. You can add servers from the TUI or CLI, e.g. `redfetch server lazarus`. Selecting "Any emu server" in the TUI or `redfetch server none` will return you to the previous functionality, a plain one-EQ-folder setup.
- The MeshGenerator shortcut from the TUI or `redfetch run meshgen` will seed the config with your current EQ & MQ path, if no previous config exists.

### Fixed
- First-run setup and uninstall could crash when encountering some çhä̶rä̶cté̶rs. 
- The standalone .exe uninstaller now works when redfetch.exe sits in a path with spaces.
- CLI prompts could hang forever if a previous app had set raw input mode in the terminal.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-07-21

### Added
- Background updates triggered on each launch of "Very Vanilla MQ", so you no longer have to see redfetch. Run MacroQuest directly. Credit: all the TUI haters

### Changed
- Navigation meshes now download by default instead of prompting. Opt out in settings. (`PROTECTED_FILES_BY_RESOURCE` still protects your custom meshes)

### Fixed
- pip/pipx in-app updates fixed on windows

## [1.4.4] - 2026-07-18

### Fixed
- A rejected OAuth token will no longer assume you're level 1.

## [1.4.3] - 2026-07-06

### Added
- A failed install will attempt to repair itself, rather than closing immediately.

## [1.4.2] - 2026-07-06

### Fixed
- The update button wouldn't launch MQ if eqbcs.exe was running.

## [1.4.1] - 2026-07-05

### Changed
- The update button once again doubles as a *launch MQ* button, even when no update occurs.

### Added
- `redfetch run` and `redfetch open` CLI commands act as shortcuts, for example `redfetch run eqgame` will start EQgame.exe, `redfetch open eqhost` will open the eqhost.txt file, etc. These mirror the TUI shortcuts.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-07-05

### Changed
- You can now update while playing. Updates take effect the next time you start Very Vanilla MQ.

### Added
- New logic for restarting VVMQ after an update. redfetch will never touch EQ nor unload MQ.

### Removed
- The "Close MQ pre-update" setting and TUI toggle.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-06-26

### Added
- `--server` on `update` and `download`: use a different server for one run.
- TUI: "Also start post-update" — launch EQBCS, MySEQ, or a custom program after a successful update. ([#18](https://github.com/RedGuides/redfetch/issues/18))
- Staff picks: Ninjadvloot.inc is now on LIVE/TEST/EMU.

### Changed
- Config paths that contain `eqgame.exe` are allowed with a warning instead of being blocked outright. ([#22](https://github.com/RedGuides/redfetch/issues/22))
- TUI: "Close MQ pre-update" and "Start MQ post-update" are now No / Ask / Yes toggles, so you can pick the prompt-each-time ("Ask") behavior from the UI instead of only on/off.
- Only settings you've actually changed are written to `settings.local.toml`, keeping the file tidy.

### Fixed
- Licensed resources will now download even if you have duplicates. ([#24](https://github.com/RedGuides/redfetch/issues/24))
- Update checks notice when a resource's subfolder changes.
- Fixed "RecursionError" on startup by rolling back a dependency.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-04-05

### Added
- Custom category directories: override where `lua`, `macros`, or `plugins` install via `CATEGORY_PATHS` in `settings.local.toml`.
- Clearer messages for users on why certain resources are skipped or blocked.

### Changed
- Rewrote the sync pipeline with separate discovery, planning, and execution stages.

### Fixed
- Staff picks: Buttonmaster was pointing at the deleted beta resource, giving everyone a 404 log line each run.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-02-02

### Added
- Staff picks: curated resources for LIVE/TEST/EMU. Turn it off if you don't care what we like.

### Changed
- Authentication now uses OAuth2, though you can still use an API key if you prefer.

### Fixed
- `publish`: `--message` can be a file path. If it’s a Keep a Changelog file, we'll use the matching version entry; otherwise the file contents are posted. Empty messages are skipped.
- Corrected maps directory handling for special resources. Sorry for the bad maps dirs all this time! Please delete the old ones from your EQ directory.
